# MythicMaker

MythicMaker is a website designed for RPG (role-playing game) enthusiasts who enjoy creating characters. The site allows users to create accounts where they can design and manage their characters. Each character profile includes detailed information such as name, race, biography, appearance, and a picture (uploaded by the user or selected from a database).

Users can edit their character's stats, such as health points, strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom, and charisma. There’s also an option to add experience points – once a certain threshold is reached, the player receives a notification about the opportunity to upgrade one of the character's attributes.

The website also provides a view of the character's current equipment, allowing for better character management.
